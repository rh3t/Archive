## **Story** 🌍
The year is 3055. Due to humanity’s negligence to Earth, the planet has become near inhabitable. With the destruction of the Earth, and the anarchy it has created, the rest of the solar system has become a battlefield. It is predicted that the surviving humans in the solar system will hunt each other to extinction. 

As a result, you’ve been tasked along with your crew to fly around the Galaxy gathering resources for what’s left of your species. Not only do you have to gather a certain amount of resources, you have to gather them all in 50 days, or humanity goes extinct.

## **Concept & Details** 📝
Odyssey is a clicker game where you and your crew fly in an upgradable ship where you fly to various planets harvesting (clicking) them over and over again to gain upgrades for your ship & crew so you can gather resources more efficiently. 

You start the game picking your name, age, and faction. These details will decide how you gather your resources, depending if it’s more environmentally negligent or not. Eventually, as time goes on and on you will have to upgrade your ship so you can mine other planets, and mine previous planets more efficiently, as each planet will have a different material that you need to save humanity. 

You will also come across traveling merchants that will sell you various technologies that can do a variety of things, from ship upgrades to resources themselves. The currency will be called Units. You can gather units by selling resources you’ve already gathered, or doing tasks for certain merchants. The player will start off with 5,000 Units.
